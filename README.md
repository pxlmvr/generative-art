# Generative Art

This project collects different experiments of generative art:

> Generative art is that post-conceptual art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist.

# Quick start

Clone the repo, cd in the folder and run `npm install`.

Install `canvas-sketck-cli`: `npm install canvas-sketch-cli --global`.

To preview any artwork run `canvas-sketch [PATH_TO_FILE]`.
